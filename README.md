JavaScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of JavaScript in a logical sequence. 

The inspiration for this project comes from the Edgecase Ruby Koans and the book 'Javascript: The Good Parts'.

Open the file jskoans.htm in your favourite browser and make the tests pass.

The koans use the [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/) test syntax and test runner. 

Get started with Ryan Anklam's [Learn JavaScript completely On the Cloud With the JavaScript Koans and Cloud9 IDE](http://blog.bittersweetryan.com/2011/08/learn-some-javascript-completely-on.html)

Getting Started
==============

Open in your browser the `jskkoans.htm` and start replacing the `__` in the files from `topics\`.

For example, if we edit `topics\about_asserts.js`, changing `__` by `true`, like the following snippet.

```javascript
    module("About Asserts (topics/about_asserts.js)");

    test("ok", function() {
        ok(true === true, 'what will satisfy the ok assertion?');
    });
```
After saving our changes we should be able to see that the first test passed in the page `jskoans.htm`.
